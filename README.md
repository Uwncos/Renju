# Renju
- Renju (*Japanese: 連珠*) is a professional variant of gomoku. It was named renju by Japanese journalist Ruikou Kuroiwa (*黒岩涙香*) on December 6, 1899 in a Japanese newspaper Yorozu chouhou (*萬朝報*). The name "*renju*" comes from the Japanese language, and means "connected pearls" in Japanese. The game is played with black and white stones on a 15×15 gridded go board. (*Wikipedia*)
